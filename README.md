This repository contains the two programming assignments (Assignment 1 and Assignment 3), required for "K22-Operating Systems" Course, Fall Semester 2019.

Each one is an abstract experiment on shared memory segment access, between multiple simultaneous readers and a single writer, subject to various constraints.
Both projects, are implemented in C.

For the time being, each folder contains the original assignment description (in greek), and the code used for the solution.
Additional descriptions or README files, all translated in English might be added later on.
